The Bag of Words approach is a successful method for document classification that represents a document as a vector of word counts. The method is based on the assumption that documents within the same class have similar word distributions. This approach has been applied to image classification, but a significant challenge exists. This paper discusses the Bag of Words approach and its potential for image classification.
